# PSY-4960-Workflow-Assignment-

Steps I followed for this assignment

1. I created an R Project
2. Using Excel, I created a spreadsheet with a column of my five favorite desserts, a column of the rating Iâ€™d give the dessert, and a third column containing roughly the quantity of said dessert I could eat. 
	2.1. I created a column titled "Desserts" and added 5 desserts: ice cream, brownies, chocolate pie, cookies, cheesecake 
	2.2. I created a second column titled "Rating" and added my ratings that corresponded with each dessert
	2.3. I created a third column titled "Quantity" and added the quantity in grams of each item that I would eat. I googled how many grams were in a common serving of each item to try to get a rough estimate of how much I could actually eat
	2.4. I saved the Excel spreadsheet as a .csv file and added it to my R Project
3. I created an R Markdown file in the R project that 1) uploads the data, 2) summarizes the three columns, and 3) visually represents the data in some way. 
	3.1. I uploaded the data using the read.csv function in R
	3.2. I summarized the data using the summary function in R 
	3.3. I created a visual representation of the data by creating a scatterplot using ggplot 
4. I created a repository and uploaded my R project, then I added this ReadMe file :)
